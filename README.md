# Flutter UIKit

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtechviral.flutteruikit&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png' height=90px/></a>

The goal of this project is to provide an ultimate collection of real world app's UIs.
While I built Flutter UIKit for my own needs, it is also intented to showcase good app structure and a clean, well-organized Flutter codebase.

The source code is **100% Dart**, and everything resides in the [/lib](https://github.com/iampawan/Flutter-UI-Kit/tree/master/lib) folder.

This project will try to **showcase only the best, most popular and well-designed templates** that you will actually need and find useful rather than overwhelming you with a plethora of low-quality ones.

Happy learning. :+1:

## Building the project

### Missing Key.Properties file

If you try to build the project straight away, you'll get an error complaining that a `key.properties` file is missing and Exit code 1 from: /Flutter-UI-Kit-master/android/gradlew app:properties:. To resolve that,

1.  Open r\Flutter-UI-Kit-master\android\app\build.gradle file and comment following lines-

```
//keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))

signingConfigs {
// release {
// keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
// keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
// storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
// storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
// }
}
buildTypes {
// release {
// signingConfig signingConfigs.release
// }
}
```

2.  Open r\Flutter-UI-Kit-master\android\local.properties and add -

```
flutter.versionName=1.0.0
flutter.versionCode=1
flutter.buildMode=release
```

### The stack & building from source

The project is currently built using the latest Flutter Master, with Dart 2 enabled.

To build the project, ensure that you have a recent version of the Flutter SDK installed. Then either run `flutter run` in the project root or use your IDE of choice.
